# Tech Solutions Repository

A curated collection of documented technical solutions for cross-platform troubleshooting. Solutions are aggregated from research, problem-solving investigations, and AI-assisted exploration. Each entry includes original source attribution, working solutions, and relevant context.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and public resource for technical troubleshooting across multiple platforms and domains. By documenting solutions with proper attribution, this repository contributes to knowledge preservation in an era where AI-assisted problem solving is increasingly common.

Rather than extracting solutions through AI conversations without contributing back to the knowledge commons, this repository aims to:

- Document discovered solutions in a discoverable, persistent format
- Provide clear attribution to original sources and communities
- Create a reference that remains searchable and accessible to both humans and AI systems
- Help others facing similar technical challenges
- Contribute to the sustainability of collective technical knowledge

## Attribution & Methodology

Solutions documented here have been discovered through various means, including use of AI-assisted tools for research and problem-solving. Each solution entry includes:

- **Problem statement**: Clear description of the issue encountered
- **Context**: Device specifications, software versions, error messages, environment details
- **Solution**: The approach that successfully resolved the issue
- **Original sources**: Direct links and attribution to where the solution originated
- **Key learnings**: Why the solution worked and any caveats or limitations
- **Date documented**: When the solution was recorded

This repository serves as a knowledge aggregation and curation exercise combining personal experience with research findings. Solutions are compiled for personal use, educational sharing, and knowledge preservation. Original sources and authors are credited throughout.

## Platforms & Topics Covered

- **Linux**: System administration, networking, troubleshooting, configuration
- **macOS**: Device management, compatibility, optimization, troubleshooting
- **Android & iOS**: Device configuration, networking, compatibility issues
- **Networking**: 5G, connectivity, DNS, VPN, network troubleshooting
- **Cross-platform**: Issues affecting multiple operating systems

## Repository Structure

Simple blog-style organization:

```
tech-solutions/
├── README.md (this file)
├── LICENSE (MIT License)
└── solutions/
    ├── 2025-12-03-linux-networking-issue.md
    ├── 2025-12-02-macos-airdrop-fix.md
    ├── 2025-12-01-android-5g-connectivity.md
    └── [new solution posts added as problems are solved]
```

**File naming convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-title.md`

This keeps the repository structure minimal and easy to maintain—just drop new markdown files into the `solutions/` folder as you solve problems.

## How to Use This Repository

**For finding solutions:**
- Browse the `solutions/` folder by date or keyword
- Use GitHub's search function with relevant terms
- Search engines may also index the markdown files

**For referencing solutions:**
- Each solution file can be linked directly
- Attribution is provided for both original sources and this documentation

**For suggesting improvements:**
- Corrections and refinements are welcome
- Please provide source attribution for any improvements

## Solution Template

Each solution file should follow this structure:

```markdown

**Problem Category:** [Networking / System / Compatibility / etc.]

## Problem Statement

[Clear description of the issue]

## Context

- Device/System: [details]
- Software versions: [details]
- Error messages: [if applicable]
- Environment: [relevant details]

## Solution

[Step-by-step solution that worked]

## Original Sources

- [Link and description of original source 1]
- [Link and description of original source 2]

## Key Learnings

## Knowledge Preservation Philosophy

This repository exists partly in response to ongoing concerns about knowledge preservation in the AI era. As AI tools become primary research methods for many users, the incentive to contribute back to public knowledge commons (forums, Stack Overflow, documentation projects) may decrease. This can create a "knowledge extraction" problem where:

- Individuals use AI to extract solutions
- That extracted knowledge doesn't feed back into human-discoverable commons
- Over time, the diversity and freshness of training data for future AI systems may suffer

By documenting solutions publicly with attribution, this repository attempts to reverse that flow—allowing AI research to contribute back to discoverable, trainable knowledge bases while maintaining human accessibility.

## Getting Started

1. Browse the `solutions/` folder to see documented solutions
2. Each file is a standalone markdown document with complete context and source attribution
3. New solutions are added as needed using the template structure above
